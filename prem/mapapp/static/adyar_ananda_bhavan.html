                Adyar Ananda Bhavan (also known as AAB or A2B) is an Indian chain of vegetarian restaurants and confectioners founded in Rajapalayam and headquartered in Adyar, Chennai. It is the oldest chain of restaurants in Chennai[according to whom?] and has 145+ outlets across India.
                A2B was founded by late Thiru K.S. Thirupathi Raja, who was the founder of Guru Sweets in Rajapalayam, Srinivasa Sweets in Bangalore (Sriramapuram) and Sri Ananda Bhavan in Washermenpet, Chennai.[3][4][5][6] This was followed by the opening of a branch in Adyar which prompted the company to add Adyar to the name Ananda Bhavan which is now called Adyar Ananda Bhavan.[citation needed]
                Adyar Ananda Bhavan now operates branches across India, most of which are in southern India.[4]
                The restaurant chain is now managed and run by Thiru. K.T. Venkatesan and Thiru. K.T. Srinivasa Raja,[7] sons of founder late Thiru. K.S. Thirupathi Raja.
